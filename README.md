This is a Next JS + Chakra UI personalized template based on [Chakra UI examples template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-chakra-ui-typescript). Live demo can be accessed at [yehez-nextchakra-starter.yehezgun.com](https://yehez-nextchakra-starter.yehezgun.com). Actually, I made this for myself so I don't need to waste my time to overthinking about the config and setup and focusing on the development.

But if you also find this template is useful, you also can use it. And of course I'm open to any feedbacks. You can fork or clone this repo and make a PR here if you have a some idea.

## ⚡ What's include here?

- Toolings for linting, formatting, and conventions configured. <br>
  `eslint`, `prettier`, `husky`, & `lint-staged`.
- ✨Basic responsive layout configuration (using Chakra UI media query)
- SEO Optimization (using `next-seo`)
- Now using Next.js 12 with Rust Compiler Minification enabled (you can disabled it at `next.config.js`)
